"New Grad Software Engineer","Roles & Responsibilities
As a New Grad at Stripe you’ll be helping increase the GDP of the internet. This has many hard and interesting challenges which require novel solutions. What is the best developer experience for making payments? How do you balance API versioning while keeping changes fast? How do you build an API generic enough for any marketplace while still being simple?

Here are some past projects by your fellow new grads:
Analyzing how much of a negative balance each merchant should be able to hold. Too much and Stripe runs a risk of fraud, too little and it impacts merchant operations.
Bundling Tax and Shipping costs into a charge flow in a simple and intuitive manner.
Allowing merchants to give granular permissions to different users of their business. At a big company, the CFO shouldn’t be making API calls nor should an engineer be accidentally actioning disputes.
Shipping Stripe to more countries and payment mechanisms (did you know there are > 100 ways to pay in the world?)
Engineering at Stripe
A core part of our engineering culture is inclusiveness: we want to accommodate people from all backgrounds and walks of life.

We believe in end-to-end ownership of projects. For any given project, we have one person on point. While they don’t necessarily have to do all the work themselves, it’s their job to make sure all the work gets done.

We launch betas and prototypes as early as we can. (The first version of Stripe, for example, had a beta user since the time we could literally only charge a credit card—we couldn’t even pay out those charges!) This helps ensure that we’re building what users actually want.

We contribute back to the community, often by building things we think are cool and by releasing open-source software.

Our shipping culture

How we recruit

Guide to the onsite interview (PDF)

Teams at Stripe
Rather than adopting extreme models of “horizontal” teams oriented around technologies (a web team, a platform team, etc.) or “vertical” teams oriented around business goals (a revenue team), we pick and choose the parts we like about both models for our teams.

Our “vertical” teams (Checkout, Ops, Product, and Risk) can operate independently, building the technology that they need to operate. Each one may not have deep expertise in every part of the stack, but they have enough that things can get done without blocking on other teams.

Our “horizontal” teams (Data, Dev tools, Internal tools, Security, Sys) provide support to the others and have deeper expertise on particular parts of the stack. It’s their job to build platforms that are so good the other teams want to use them, rather than being forced into it.

Teams at Stripe are relatively fluid. Some people stay on a given team for a handful of months, while others seem to prefer sticking to their team permanently. Once you join, we’ll work with you to choose a team to get started with—it’s all pretty flexible.

Stripe’s engineering challenges

You should include these in your application:
Links to online profiles you use (GitHub, Twitter, etc).
A description of your work history (whether as a resume, LinkedIn profile, or prose).
If there are teams you’d be particularly interested in working on, please let us know (and tell us why!). This way we can have you interview with the people you’ll likely work best with. This won’t bind you to a specific team—we can figure that out together as the we learn more about your interests and strengths."

"Research Engineer (Data Center Liquid Cooling)","Today’s high performance computing (HPC) data centers are the technology template for tomorrow’s regular data centers. As a result, power consumption by processors both CPUs and GPUs are expected to increase, which translate to higher cooling demand. This high cooling demand requires an advanced approach to liquid cooling, instead of the dependency on traditional air cooling. One technique is by employing hybrid cooling, in which a combination of liquid and air cooling solutions are used to cater for different components on the servers. Heat flux dissipated from high powered components are taken care of by liquid cooling with heat sinks directly mounted on the components and heat from the low powered components are addressed by using traditional forced convective air cooling. As such, the fluid temperatures can be increased significantly compared to the conventional system. Under high ambient temperature, the chiller, CRAC units and system fans, which are the main energy consumers, can be eliminated. This leads to a tremendous energy saving for cooling system which will result in very low PUE. This project is on the comparative study of conventional CRAC air cooling and high ambient temperature hybrid cooling.The Research Fellow and Research Engineer are responsible for the following three tasks:
Benchmarking of the performance of such a hybrid cooling system with air cooled system and record its live PUE.
Reliability tests which are required due to the widespread concern of the close proximity of liquid (water) with electronics on the server.
Feasibility study of manufacturability vs cost effectiveness of cold plates.

"Research Engineer (Data Center Liquid Cooling)","Today’s high performance computing (HPC) data centers are the technology template for tomorrow’s regular data centers. As a result, power consumption by processors both CPUs and GPUs are expected to increase, which translate to higher cooling demand. This high cooling demand requires an advanced approach to liquid cooling, instead of the dependency on traditional air cooling. One technique is by employing hybrid cooling, in which a combination of liquid and air cooling solutions are used to cater for different components on the servers. Heat flux dissipated from high powered components are taken care of by liquid cooling with heat sinks directly mounted on the components and heat from the low powered components are addressed by using traditional forced convective air cooling. As such, the fluid temperatures can be increased significantly compared to the conventional system. Under high ambient temperature, the chiller, CRAC units and system fans, which are the main energy consumers, can be eliminated. This leads to a tremendous energy saving for cooling system which will result in very low PUE. This project is on the comparative study of conventional CRAC air cooling and high ambient temperature hybrid cooling.The Research Fellow and Research Engineer are responsible for the following three tasks:
Benchmarking of the performance of such a hybrid cooling system with air cooled system and record its live PUE.
Reliability tests which are required due to the widespread concern of the close proximity of liquid (water) with electronics on the server.
Feasibility study of manufacturability vs cost effectiveness of cold plates.

"Intern - Analytics/Modelling Engineer","Req. ID: 142681
Title of project: Virtual metrology modelling based on image data from wafer inspection systems
Description: In semiconductor manufacturing virtual metrology refers to methods to predict the properties of a wafer based on machine parameters and sensor data in the production equipment, without performing the (costly) physical measurement of the wafer properties. Water inspection systems (WIS) are installed in many of the latest semiconductor equipment and these are used to capture high resolution images of wafers after various process steps. This image data is relatively inexpensive and available for all wafers as opposed to conventional metrology and can be used to predict physical measurements. In this project you will build machine learning models to predict metrology data using wis image data.
Scope: Collaborate with experienced process control engineers and process owners to understand specific process control and monitoring requirements that can be met by virtual metrology. Learn and apply latest machine learning/deep learning techniques to build robust predictive models.
Deliverable: Create a framework to build, score and maintain repeatable WIS based Virtual metrology models. Deploy a Virtual metrology model for production use.
Recommended qualifications: Computer Engineering / Electrical Engineering

"Software Engineering Intern","Roles & Responsibilities
At Stripe, we are working hard at growing the GDP of the internet by building products and processes to help run an online business. You will work on projects that span technologies, systems, and processes where you will design, test, and ship great code every day. The work you do will affect Stripe and its users.

Our interns are full-time engineers; they have full deploy access and push code into production from day one. We keep our intern class small to ensure every single one has dedicated mentorship and gets to work on tough technical challenges, such as rebuilding our statistics aggregation service, migrating jobs to a cluster-based scheduler, or making easy-to-understand error messages for Stripe Checkout!

Throughout the summer, you’ll attend company all-hands meetings, learn from our speaker series, and participate in special intern events (such as s’mores making, bubble soccer, bowling, and trivia nights).

You may be fit for this role if you:
Plan to graduate in 2021 or 2022
Have strong CS fundamentals through a current pursuit of Bachelor’s, Master’s, or PhD degree in computer science, math or related discipline
Some programming experience (either in class, in your personal time, or at a job). We work mostly in Ruby, with some Scala and Go. However, languages can be learned: we care much more about your general engineering skill than knowledge of a particular language or framework
Thrive in a collaborative environment involving different stakeholders and subject matter experts
Take pride in working on projects to successful completion involving a wide variety of technologies and systems
Enjoy working with a diverse group of people with different expertise (for example, ¼ of Stripes work in a country that’s different from the one they grew up in). Almost every role at Stripe collaborates with some engineers, from Sales and Support in sharing feedback from our customers; to Legal and Accounting in supporting our systems for tracking money movement and reporting around the world. It’s not expected that any single candidate would have expertise across all of these areas—we’re looking for candidates that are particularly strong in at least one area, and have some interest and capabilities in the others. For instance, we have wonderful team members who are really focused on their customers’ needs and building amazing user experiences, but didn’t work on APIs before joining Stripe.
What’s it like to work at Stripe?
Stripe is helping the internet fulfill its potential as a platform for economic progress by building software tools that accelerate global economic access and technological development. Stripe makes it easy to start, run and scale an internet business from anywhere in the world.

Stripe is, at its heart, an engineering company. To provide a missing pillar of core internet infrastructure, we hire people with a broad set of technical skills (and from a wide variety of backgrounds) who are ready to take on some of the most challenging problems in the industry – from reliably handling 100M API requests per day, to building adaptive machine learning as a result of years of data science and infrastructure work, and enabling entrepreneurs worldwide to start a global internet business.

We look at Stripe as a constant work in progress and the same is true of our people; for all of us, we believe the best is yet to come. We’re here to support each other in our curiosity and creativity – which we pursue through thoughtful discussion and knowledge-sharing among a diverse set of peers and colleagues.

We encourage all engineers to transition teams once every year and a half and also take on short-term projects with other teams across Stripe. This enables engineers to learn how different parts of Stripe work while also establishing stronger ties and cross-pollination between groups.

We contribute to existing open-source projects and the people working on them, and we release several tools as open-source.

We want to work in a company of warm, inclusive people who treat their colleagues exceptionally well. The kind of people who are committed to going out of their way to help other Stripes in the short-term and pushing them to improve over the long-term (by helping them to get better at what they do).

We’re a highly cross-functional organization and view that as part of the fun: we design our space to encourage as much collaboration as possible. We have long tables in the kitchen for a reason (to enable everyone to meet new people and learn from them). We also have a culture of transparency that we carry through to email communication, ensuring that Stripes all around the world have the information they need to make good local decisions.

In both our products and our people, we aim to reflect, represent and advocate for all of our users, globally. Our users transcend geography, culture and language; what we share, collectively, is a drive to create a fairer, more economically interconnected world.

You should include these in your application:
Links to online profiles you’d like to share (GitHub, Twitter, StackOverflow, etc) so we can get to know you better!
A description of your work history (either as a resume or LinkedIn profile)"

Introducing Tookitaki
Tookitaki is providing machine learning-powered enterprise solutions to address regulatory compliance problems in the financial services sector. Incorporated in November 2014 in Singapore, the company is led by a core team with cumulative 30-years’ experience in finance, AI and big data analytics. Backed by institutional investors such as Jungle Ventures and Spring Seeds (a subsidiary of the Singapore Government), the company’s accolades include:
We are among the selected 21 companies which got accreditation from the government of Singapore for their stringent technology, finance and operations due diligence (www.imda.gov.sg/industry-development/programmes-and-grants/startups/accreditation-at-sgd)
We won the first place in the MAS FinTech Awards (Singapore SME) in the regulatory compliance space from the Monetary Authority of Singapore for our approach to make the workflows in AML and Reconciliation scalable and highly auditable (beyond ML based black box approach) (www.mas.gov.sg/News-and-Publications/Media-Releases/2016/Ten-FinTech-companies-recognised-for-innovative-solutions-at-inaugural-FinTech-Awards.aspx)
We are voted as one of the top 21 AI start-ups focusing on the financial services space by medici (www.letstalkpayments.com/medici-top-21-ai-companies/)
We graduated from Nomura's corporate innovation program in November 2017 where we successfully delivered our product – Reconciliation Management Suite – in a pilot environment (https://inc42.com/buzz/nomura-voyager-fintech-accelerator-voyager-demo-day/)
In regulatory compliance, we focus on anti-money laundering and reconciliation and our products – Alerts Management Suite (AMS) and Reconciliation Management Suite (RMS) – cater to these areas, respectively. The mission or goal is to achieve 40% operational efficiency with significant savings in infrastructure and operational costs.Tookitaki's unique selling proposition (USP) is in our approach where we combine our proprietary modelling technique with our complete auditable framework to make the process dynamic and highly explainable (moving out of the black box approach). Moreover, our flexible on-premise and cloud-packaging capabilities, along with the option of easy integration to exiting core-banking applications (REST API end points), make the solution deployment faster with lesser barrier to entry.
Today, regulatory compliance processes have become more complex and fluidic, increasing the chances for rule-based models to fail. Banks need to move beyond static rule-based systems and adopt a new approach to prevent financial and reputation loss. Tookitaki bridges the gap with its innovative software products – AMS, RMS and PMS.

Why Cisco
We connect everything: people, processes, data, and things. We innovate everywhere, taking bold risks to shape the technologies that give us smart cities, connected cars, and handheld hospitals. And we do it in style with unique personalities who aren’t afraid to change the way the world works, lives, plays and learns.
We are thought leaders, tech geeks, pop culture aficionados, and we even have a few purple haired rock stars. We celebrate the creativity and diversity that fuels our innovation. We are dreamers and we are doers.
We Are Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool."

Why Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!"

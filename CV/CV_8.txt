Operations Manager/Veteran Seeks Manufacturing Manager Position
Dear Recruiter,

When I saw the job posting looking for a "Multi-Functional Manufacturing Associate Manager" for Lockheed Martin, I knew I had to submit my resume. I am a hard-working and motivated Operations Manager with over 12 years of leadership experience and am ready for my next adventure! I am currently looking for an opportunity to serve my country again and I know my skills and experiences would be a good fit for the position and the Lockheed Martin team overall.

As you can see from my attached resume, I honorably served six years in the United States Army as a Sergeant and successfully led a team during a 14-month deployment to the Middle East. Having the opportunity to have been in the military has developed and shaped me into the leader I am today. I am currently the Vice President of Operations for a solar manufacturing company in Livermore, CA. Iâ€™m responsible for the day-to-day operations of the company, which is spread out between two manufacturing facilities in CA & MI.

I am a team player with excellent communication skills and strong motivation in the workplace. I am also a very detail oriented and an organized individual and believe that every job requires a strong dedication to duty and commitment to ensure that it is carried through to completion. As a result of this mindset and work ethic, I've been fortunate enough to hold six different positions within my current company, constantly striving to learn more and achieve the goals of the company.

I believe that my skills and experience make me an excellent match for this position. Thank you for taking the time to review my resume. You can contact me with any questions by emailing me at hello@kickresume.com or by calling me at 9999999999. I look forward to the possibility of discussing this exciting opportunity with you.

Sincerely,

Gabriel Fernandez

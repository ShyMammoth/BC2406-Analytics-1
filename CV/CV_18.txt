Compliance: Verification Specialist
To Whom It May Concern, 

In today's customer service driven society, friendly, detail-oriented, and timely service is a sought-after part of any business looking to grow successfully. Every company wants great reviews and repeat business, so why not hire team members? 

I earned my marketing degree learning that without customers, your business doesn't exist and without happy customers, your business will fail. Throughout my internships with Disney World and Enterprise Rent-A-Car, I learned how to field questions and concerns from all kinds of people while maintaining a cheerful, problem solving attitude. I thrive on meeting and exceeding the needs of customers, providing them with exceptional experience and leaving them wanting to return. 

I am passionate about everything I do in life and I love to motivate all around me. I thrive on hard work and achievement. Details and creativity are my best assets. Being a successful problem-solver leaves me fulfilled at the end of each day.

I am exactly who you are looking for to fill this compliance role. I have attached my resume along with this letter. Thank you for taking the time to consider me and I look forward to hearing from you soon and starting my journey with _company name_. 


Best regards, 

Ryan
